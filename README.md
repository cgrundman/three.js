## 01 - Getting Started

The first project is an instroduction to the key components of Three.js. The main 4 necessary components are: a renderer, a camera, an object, and a light source. This project creates a simple mesh object and also showcases controls and animation.

## 02 - Earth

The second project builds upon the first to render an Earth. The project uses mesh layering, as well as importing custom functions for the starfield and the glow around the planet. Special thanks to [Pixel Planet Imporium](https://planetpixelemporium.com/) for the base images used for the meshes.
